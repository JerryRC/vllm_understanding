The blogger starts in a lying position on her back.\n2. She lifts her legs and arms off the ground, transitioning into a side plank position.\n3. She holds this position for a few seconds.\n4. She lowers herself back down to the starting position.\n5. She repeats this sequence multiple times.\n\nBy carefully counting each transition from the lying position to the side plank position and back, we can track the number of complete side plank lift movements.\n\nAfter analyzing the video:\n- The blogger completes 10 full side plank lift movements.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{10}", "predicted_count": 10, "error": null, "model_name": "qwen2.5-vl-7b-instruct"}
