We count each time the blogger completes a full bend to the left and returns to an upright position as one complete movement.\n\nBy carefully analyzing each frame:\n- Frame 1: Starting position\n- Frame 2: Bending to the left\n- Frame 3: Returning to upright\n- Frame 4: Bending to the left again\n- Frame 5: Returning to upright\n- Frame 6: Bending to the left again\n- Frame 7: Returning to upright\n- Frame 8: Bending to the left again\n- Frame 9: Returning to upright\n- Frame 10: Bending to the left again\n- Frame 11: Returning to upright\n\nBased on this analysis, the blogger has completed 5 full side stretch (L) movements.\n\n\\boxed{5}", "predicted_count": 5, "error": null, "model_name": "qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct"}
