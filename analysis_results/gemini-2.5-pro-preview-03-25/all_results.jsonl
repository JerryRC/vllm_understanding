In this video, the blogger gets into the plank position once and holds it for the duration indicated by the timer (30 seconds, counting down from 29 to 00). She performs this hold as one continuous set. Therefore, she completes only one plank movement (one set of holding the plank) in this video segment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The blogger completed one plank movement, which involved holding the position for the timed duration.\n\n\\boxed{1}", "predicted_count": 1, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25"}

The timer starts at 30 seconds.\n3.  **00:03 - 00:08:** The woman transitions into the starting position for the single leg bridge. She lies on her back, bends her knees, places her feet flat, lifts her hips into a bridge, supported by her shoulders and her right foot.\n4.  **00:09:** She extends her left leg.

This exercise involves stabilizing the body with the right leg planted on the floor while lifting and lowering the left leg. A \"left single leg bridge\" would involve stabilizing with the left leg and moving the right leg.

However, the movement performed is an *isometric hold* of the side plank position after the initial lift. A \"raise\" in this context usually implies a dynamic repetition where the hips are lowered and then raised multiple times. Since the woman lifts her hips once at the beginning (00:01) and then holds the position without any further lowering and raising repetitions until she comes down at the end (00:55), she does not perform any dynamic \"raises\" as typically defined for this exercise type. She performs the initial lift into the hold, but zero repetitions of the raise/dip movement itself.\n\nTherefore, based on the standard definition of a \"Side Plank Raise\" involving dynamic hip movement, the count is 0.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe blogger performs the initial lift into the side plank position but then holds it statically. She does not perform any dynamic repetitions of lowering and raising her hips.
