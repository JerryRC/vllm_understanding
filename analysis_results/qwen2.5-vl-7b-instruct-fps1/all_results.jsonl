She then extends her left arm forward and bends her right leg.\n   - This completes one full rainbow movement.\n\n3. **Second Rainbow Movement**:\n   - She repeats the same sequence as above, extending her left arm forward and bending her right leg, then extending her right arm forward and bending her left leg.\n   - This completes another full rainbow movement.\n\n4. **Third Rainbow Movement**:\n   - She continues the sequence, extending her right arm forward and bending her left leg, then extending her left arm forward and bending her right leg.\n   - This completes another full rainbow movement.\n\n5. **Fourth Rainbow Movement**:\n   - She repeats the sequence again, extending her left arm forward and bending her right leg, then extending her right arm forward and bending her left leg.\n   - This completes another full rainbow movement.\n\n6. **Fifth Rainbow Movement**:\n   - She continues the sequence, extending her right arm forward and bending her left leg, then extending her left arm forward and bending her right leg.\n   - This completes another full rainbow movement.\n\n7. **Sixth Rainbow Movement**:\n   - She repeats the sequence once more, extending her left arm forward and bending her right leg, then extending her right arm forward and bending her left leg.\n   -
