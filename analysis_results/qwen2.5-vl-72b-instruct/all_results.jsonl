I will count each full circle as one movement.\n\nHere's the step-by-step count:\n\n- Frame 1: Starting position\n- Frame 2: Leg moves down\n- Frame 3: Leg moves up (1st circle)\n- Frame 4: Leg moves down\n- Frame 5: Leg moves up (2nd circle)\n- Frame 6: Leg moves down\n- Frame 7: Leg moves up (3rd circle)\n- Frame 8: Leg moves down\n- Frame 9: Leg moves up (4th circle)\n- Frame 10: Leg moves down\n- Frame 11: Leg moves up (5th circle)\n- Frame 12: Leg moves down\n- Frame 13: Leg moves up (6th circle)\n- Frame 14: Leg moves down\n- Frame 15: Leg moves up (7th circle)\n- Frame 16: Leg moves down\n- Frame 17: Leg moves up (8th circle)\n- Frame 18: Leg moves down\n- Frame 19: Leg moves up (9th circle)\n- Frame 20: Leg moves down\n- Frame 21: Leg moves up (10th circle)\n\nThe blogger completes 10 full leg circles before switching legs.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{10}", "predicted_count": 10, "error": null, "model_name": "qwen2.5-vl-72b-instruct"}
