These are preparatory or illustrative movements, not full sit-ups or crunches.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the frame-by-frame analysis, the blogger completes a total of 5 sit-up movements during the demonstration of traditional sit-ups between 00:16 and 00:26. No other complete sit-up movements are performed in the rest of the video.\n\nThe completed sit-ups are observed at the following timestamps (approximate end of the upward phase):\n1.  00:18\n2.  00:20\n3.  00:22\n4.  00:24\n5.  00:26\n\nTherefore, the total number of completed sit-up movements is 5.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{5}$", "predicted_count": 5, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

A standard jumping jack involves two phases:\n1.  Jumping from a standing position (feet together, arms at sides) to a position with feet spread wide apart and arms raised (often overhead or to the sides).\n2.  Jumping back to the initial standing position (feet together, arms at sides).\n\nLet's analyze the video frame by frame:\n\n*   **00:00 - 00:01:** The blogger is in the starting position: feet together, arms by his sides.\n*   **00:01:** The blogger initiates the first jumping jack. He jumps, and his legs begin to spread, and arms begin to move upwards and outwards.\n*   **00:02:** His legs are spread wider, and his arms are moving further up.\n*   **00:03:** He reaches the peak of the \"out\" phase of the jumping jack: legs are wide apart, and arms are raised (though not fully overhead, they are significantly abducted and raised, consistent with the movement).\n*   **00:04:** He begins the \"in\" phase of the jumping jack. He jumps, bringing his legs together and his arms down.\n*   **00:05:** He returns to the starting position: feet together, arms by his sides. This completes **one** full jumping jack.\n*   **00:06:** The blogger is momentarily in the starting position. He then makes a slight movement, his arms abduct slightly, and he bends his knees a little, but he does not perform the characteristic jump to spread his legs or raise his arms significantly for a second jumping jack. This movement is not a clear initiation of another jumping jack.\n*   **00:07:** The video ends. No further jumping jack movement is completed or clearly started.\n\nBased on this analysis, the blogger completes one full jumping jack movement. The first jack starts around 00:01 and completes at 00:05 when he returns to the initial standing position. The slight movement at 00:06 does not constitute the beginning of a new jumping jack before the video ends.\n\nTherefore, the total number of completed jumping jack movements is 1.\n\n\\boxed{1}", "predicted_count": 1, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The video shows the blogger performing a **barbell deadlift**, not a front raise. A front raise involves lifting weights (like dumbbells or a barbell) straight out in front of the body, primarily targeting the shoulders. A deadlift involves lifting a barbell from the floor to a standing position. I will count the number of deadlift repetitions.\n\nA complete deadlift repetition consists of:\n1.  Starting with the barbell on the floor.\n2.  Lifting the barbell until the person is standing fully erect, with hips and knees locked out.\n3.  Lowering the barbell back to the floor under control.\n\nLet's break down the video:\n\n*   **0:00 - 0:11:** The blogger is setting up for the lift, adjusting his grip and stance. No lift has started.\n*   **0:12:** The blogger begins the upward movement of the first lift.\n*   **0:14:** The blogger reaches the top of the first lift, standing erect.\n*   **0:15 - 0:16:** The blogger lowers the barbell back towards the floor.\n*   **0:16:** The first repetition is completed as the bar is near/at the floor.\n\n*   **0:17:** The blogger begins the upward movement of the second lift.\n*   **0:19 - 0:20:** The blogger reaches the top of the second lift, standing erect.\n*   **0:21 - 0:22:** The blogger lowers the barbell back towards the floor.\n*   **0:22:** The second repetition is completed as the bar reaches the floor.\n\n*   **0:23 - 0:24:** The blogger bends over further and appears to be releasing the bar or finishing the set.

The first person is clearly \"the blogger\" being featured. The montage clips at the end are very short and seem to be illustrative B-roll footage, possibly from other contexts or promotional material for the \"Power Press.\" While the person in the red shirt in the montage strongly resembles or is the same as the initial blogger, these are presented differently from his main demonstration.\n\nFor clarity and to focus on the primary, continuous demonstration by \"the blogger\" as featured in *this specific video's narrative flow*, I will count the set he performs in the well-lit room (0:17-0:22). If the montage clips were intended as a continuation of *his* workout in *this video*, the presentation would likely be different. The request is about \"this video of a video blogger performing the push up movement.\" The most direct and unambiguous interpretation is his dedicated set.\n\nTherefore, focusing on the clear, continuous set performed by the primary blogger in his main demonstration:\n\n1.  **0:17 - 0:18:** First push-up (down and up).\n2.  **0:18 - 0:19:** Second push-up (down and up).\n3.  **0:19 - 0:20:** Third push-up (down and up).\n4.  **0:20 - 0:21:** Fourth push-up (down and up).\n5.  **0:21 - 0:22:** Fifth push-up (down and up).\n\nThe blogger completed 5 push-ups in his main demonstration segment. The montage clips, while likely featuring him, are presented as separate, illustrative examples rather than a continuation of the specific workout being documented.\n\nFinal count based on the primary demonstration:\nThe blogger completes 5 push-ups between 0:17 and 0:22.\n\n\\boxed{5}", "predicted_count": 5, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

If we consider the on-screen counter, these are his 11th through 20th repetitions of his workout set. The question asks for the number of pull-ups completed *in total* (which implies within the scope of the video provided for analysis).\n\nFinal count of pull-up movements completed in the video: 10.\n\nThe reasoning for each count is based on observing the blogger starting from an extended arm position (or near extension), pulling his chin over the bar, and (for the first 9 reps) returning to an extended position. The 10th rep is counted because he achieves the peak position (chin over bar) before the video ends.\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed 10 pull-up movements in this video.\n\nThe on-screen counter starts at 10 (implying 10 were done before the video clip).\n1.  1st rep in video: counter becomes 11.\n2.  2nd rep in video: counter becomes 12.\n3.  3rd rep in video: counter becomes 13.\n4.  4th rep in video: counter becomes 14.\n5.  5th rep in video: counter becomes 15.\n6.  6th rep in video: counter becomes 16.\n7.  7th rep in video: counter becomes 17.\n8.  8th rep in video: counter becomes 18.\n9.  9th rep in video: counter becomes 19.\n10. 10th rep in video: counter stays 19 (video ends before it would update to 20).\n\nSo, 10 pull-ups are performed and completed within the duration of this video clip.\n\n\\boxed{10}", "predicted_count": 10, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

Arms extended. **Rep 12 completed.**\n*   **00:31 (late) - 00:33:** The blogger lowers the dumbbells to his chest. He attempts to push them up but struggles significantly and does not achieve full extension. He then lowers them slightly and prepares to sit up. This is a failed or incomplete repetition.\n*   **00:33 - 00:34:** The blogger sits up, placing the dumbbells on his thighs.\n\nBased on this frame-by-frame analysis, the blogger completed 12 full bench pressing movements. The 13th attempt was not completed.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe blogger completed 12 bench pressing movements.\n\n1.  Lowered at 00:02, pushed up by 00:03.\n2.  Lowered at 00:04, pushed up by 00:05.\n3.

The downward phase is not shown.\n\nReasoning for the count:\nThe first 13 movements do not meet the criteria for a completed pull-up as the chin never clearly surpasses the height of the rings. They are partial warm-up movements.\nThe 14th movement is an L-sit pull-up. The blogger successfully pulls their chin above the rings, completing the upward phase of the pull-up. Although the video ends before the downward phase is shown, the act of pulling up to the required height (chin over rings) is generally considered completing the \"pull-up\" part of the repetition. If the question implies a full cycle (up and down), then zero would be completed. However, \"completed pull up movements\" usually refers to successfully achieving the top position.\n\nGiven this, only the last movement where the chin clearly goes over the rings can be considered a completed pull-up movement (at least the concentric/upward phase).\n\nFinal Count: 1\n\nThe blogger completed 1 pull-up movement where the chin clearly went above the rings. The preceding 13 movements were partials.\n\n\\boxed{1}", "predicted_count": 1, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The movement originates from the shoulder joint (shoulder flexion).\n\n**Analysis of the video for \"Front Raise\" movements:**\n\n*   **00:00 - 00:01:** Blogger is in the starting position for curls.\n*   **00:01 - 00:02:** Blogger performs a bicep curl with his right arm. The dumbbell moves upwards by bending the elbow.\n*   **00:02 - 00:04:** Blogger lowers the right arm and begins a bicep curl with his left arm.\n*   This pattern of alternating bicep curls continues throughout the video. At no point does he lift the dumbbells forward with straight or nearly straight arms from the shoulder joint.\n\nSince the blogger is performing bicep curls and not front raises, the number of front raise movements completed is zero.\n\nIf the question was about bicep curls, I would count them as follows:\n1.  Right arm curl (00:01-00:02)\n2.  Left arm curl (00:03-00:05)\n3.  Right arm curl (00:06-00:07)\n4.  Left arm curl (00:08-00:10)\n5.  Right arm curl (00:11-00:12)\n6.

Right arm curl (00:23-00:24)\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for **front raise movements**.\n\nBased on the definition of a front raise and the movements shown in the video, the blogger has completed 0 front raise movements.\n\n\\boxed{0}", "predicted_count": 0, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

A complete pushup consists of lowering the body from a straight-arm plank position until the chest is close to the ground, and then pushing back up to the starting straight-arm plank position. In this video, the blogger starts in the \"down\" position.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1.  **Initial Position (00:00):** The video starts with the blogger in the lowered (down) position of a pushup, with their chest close to the ground.\n\n2.  **First Pushup (00:00 - 00:01):**\n    *   At 00:00, the blogger begins to push upwards.\n    *   By 00:01, the blogger has fully extended their arms and reached the top (plank) position. This completes the **first pushup**.\n    *   The person standing and supervising audibly counts \"One\" at approximately 00:01, confirming the completion of the first pushup.\n\n3.  **Second Pushup (00:02 - 00:04):**\n    *   From 00:01 to 00:02, the blogger holds the top position.\n    *   At 00:02, the blogger begins to lower their body.\n    *   By 00:03, the blogger is in the lowered (down) position.\n    *   From 00:03 to 00:04, the blogger pushes upwards again.\n    *   By 00:04, the blogger has fully extended their arms and reached the top (plank) position. This completes the **second pushup**.\n    *   The supervisor audibly counts \"Two\" at approximately 00:04, confirming the completion of the second pushup.\n\n4.  **Third Pushup (00:05 - 00:07):**\n    *   From 00:04 to 00:05, the blogger holds the top position.\n    *   At 00:05, the blogger begins to lower their body.\n    *   By 00:06, the blogger is in the lowered (down) position.\n    *   From 00:06 to 00:07, the blogger pushes upwards again.\n    *   By 00:07, the blogger has fully extended their arms and reached the top (plank) position. This completes the **third pushup**.\n    *   The supervisor audibly counts \"Three\" at approximately 00:07, confirming the completion of the third pushup.\n\n5.  **Incomplete Fourth Pushup (00:08 - 00:09):**\n    *   From 00:07 to 00:08, the blogger holds the top position.\n    *   At 00:08, the blogger begins to lower their body for another pushup.\n    *   By 00:09 (when the video ends), the blogger is in the lowered (down) position. However, they do not push back up before the video cuts off. Therefore, this is an incomplete pushup and is not counted towards the total completed pushups.\n\nBased on this frame-by-frame analysis and the audible cues from the supervisor, the blogger has completed 3 pushups in total.\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed 3 pushups.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n- Pushup 1: Completed at 00:01 (movement from down to up).\n- Pushup 2: Completed at 00:04 (movement from down to up, after going down from 00:02-00:03).\n- Pushup 3: Completed at 00:07 (movement from down to up, after going down from 00:05-00:06).\nThe movement from 00:08-00:09 is only the downward phase of a pushup, and the upward phase is not completed before the video ends.\n\nTherefore, the total number of completed pushups is 3.\n\n\\boxed{3}", "predicted_count": 3, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The question asks for movements \"completed in total\".\n*   At 0:00, arms are high and moving down.\n*   At 0:01, arms are at the bottom.

The video ends at 0:09 as arms are coming down but are not yet at the bottom. This rep is not completed.\n\nSo, counting the repetitions that are *fully completed* within the video's duration:\n1.  Completion of a rep (started before video) occurs between 0:00 and 0:01.\n2.  A new rep starts around 0:01, peaks at 0:02, and completes (arms down) by 0:03-0:04.\n3.  A new rep starts around 0:04, peaks at 0:05, and completes (arms down) by 0:07.\n4.  A new rep starts around 0:07, peaks at 0:08, but is not completed by the end of the video at 0:09.\n\nTherefore, there are 3 completed front raise movements.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe blogger completes the following front raise movements:\n1.  The first movement is already in its downward phase at the start of the video (0:00) and completes as her arms reach the bottom position around 0:01.\n2.  The second movement starts around 0:01, with her arms reaching the peak height around 0:02, and then lowered back to the starting position by 0:03-0:04.\n3.

This is the middle/end of the \"out\" phase of a jumping jack.\n*   **00:01:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 1st jumping jack.**\n*   **00:02:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:03:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 2nd jumping jack.**\n*   **00:04:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:05:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 3rd jumping jack.**\n*   **00:06:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:07:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 4th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:08:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:09:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 5th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:10:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:11:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 6th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:12:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:13:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 7th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:14:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:15:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 8th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:16:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:17:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 9th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:18:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:19:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 10th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:20:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:21:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 11th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:22:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:23:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 12th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:24:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up.\n*   **00:25:** Blogger brings feet together and arms down. **This completes the 13th jumping jack.**\n*   **00:26:** Blogger jumps feet apart and arms up. The video ends here, so this jumping jack is not completed.\n\nReasoning Summary:\nI identified the \"blogger\" as the person on the far right. I defined a complete jumping jack as the movement from feet together/arms down, to feet apart/arms up, and back to feet together/arms down. I counted each time the blogger returned to the \"feet together, arms down\" position.\n\nThe blogger completes a jumping jack at approximately:\n1.  00:01\n2.  00:03\n3.  00:05\n4.  00:07\n5.  00:09\n6.  00:11\n7.  00:13\n8.  00:15\n9.  00:17\n10. 00:19\n11. 00:21\n12. 00:23\n13. 00:25\n\nThe movement at 00:26 is the first half of a jumping jack, but it is not completed before the video ends.\n\nTherefore, the blogger has completed 13 jumping jack movements.\n\n\\boxed{13}", "predicted_count": 13, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

A complete front raise movement consists of raising the weight from a lower position (arms extended downwards) to shoulder height (or slightly above) and then lowering it back down.\n\nHere's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **0:00 - 0:01:** The video starts with the blogger having the weight already raised to shoulder height. She then lowers it. This completes the **first** repetition.\n2.  **0:01 - 0:03:** She raises the weight from the lowered position up to shoulder height (peak around 0:02) and then lowers it back down. This completes the **second** repetition.\n3.  **0:03 - 0:05:** She raises the weight again (peak around 0:04) and lowers it. This completes the **third** repetition.\n4.  **0:05 - 0:07:** She raises the weight (peak around 0:06) and lowers it. This completes the **fourth** repetition.\n5.  **0:07 - 0:09:** She raises the weight (peak around 0:08) and lowers it. This completes the **fifth** repetition.\n6.  **0:09 - 0:11:** She raises the weight (peak around 0:10) and lowers it.

This completes the **seventh** repetition.\n8.  **0:13 - 0:14 (end of video):** She raises the weight to shoulder height (peak around 0:14). The video ends before she lowers the weight for this repetition. Therefore, this movement is not fully completed within the video's duration.\n\nBased on this analysis, the blogger has completed 7 full front raise movements.\n\n\\boxed{7}", "predicted_count": 7, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

No further pull-ups are attempted by this individual. At 00:28 he re-grips the bar but does not perform another pull-up before the video ends.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\nEach pull-up was counted when the blogger started from a position with arms extended, pulled his chin above the bar, and then returned to the arms-extended position. This cycle was observed 8 times.\n\nThe completed pull-ups are:\n1.  00:00 - 00:03\n2.  00:03 - 00:06\n3.  00:06 - 00:09\n4.  00:09 - 00:12\n5.  00:12 - 00:14\n6.  00:16 - 00:20 (after glitch)\n7.  00:20 - 00:23\n8.  00:23 - 00:26\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed a total of 8 pull-ups.\n\n\\boxed{8}", "predicted_count": 8, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

No bench is used, and the movement is not a press from the chest.\n4.  **0:41 - 0:42**: The camera is dropped and the view becomes inverted. No exercise is visible.\n5.  **0:42 - 0:44**: The blogger picks up the camera and is talking again.

This counts as a completed situp.\n\nThe count of 32 seems correct and consistent after careful re-evaluation.\n\nFinal check on the very first few, as they are rapid:\n0:00 - Down\n0:01 - Up (1)\n0:01 - Down\n0:02 - Up (2)\n0:02 - Down\n0:03 - Up (3)\n0:04 - Down\n0:04 - Up (4) (This is where my previous list had 0:05 for the 4th, let's be precise)\n    *   At 0:03, person is up (3rd rep).\n    *   By late 0:03, person is going down.\n    *   At 0:04, person is fully up again (4th rep).\n    *   At 0:05, person is fully up again (5th rep).\n    *   At 0:06, person is fully up again (6th rep).\n    *   At 0:07, person is fully up again (7th rep).\n    *   At 0:08, person is going down.\n    *   At 0:09, person is fully up again (8th rep).\n\nThis changes the count.

Video ends at the peak of this situp.\n\nThis detailed re-evaluation, focusing on each second mark where a situp peak occurs, yields 36. The initial faster pace was tricky.\n\nReasoning:\nA situp is counted when the individual's torso reaches the peak \"up\" position from a lying \"down\" position.\n1.  Peak at 0:01\n2.

His legs are initially straight.\n4.  **00:15:** The blogger bends his knees, placing his feet flat on the bench. This is part of the setup for a bent-knee sit-up.\n5.  **00:16 - 00:18:** The blogger crosses his arms over his chest. He is now in the starting position for the sit-up.\n6.  **00:19 - 00:20:** The blogger is in the starting position, talking and explaining the movement.\n7.  **First Sit-up Movement (00:21 - 00:24):**\n    *   **00:21:** The blogger begins to lift his upper body (head, shoulders, and upper back) off the bench. This is the upward phase of the sit-up.\n    *   **00:22:** The blogger reaches the peak of the upward movement. His upper back is clearly off the bench.\n    *   **00:23:** The blogger begins to lower his upper body back towards the bench. This is the downward phase.\n    *   **00:24:** The blogger's back fully returns to the bench. This completes the first sit-up.\n8.  **00:25 - 00:32:** The blogger remains lying on his back and continues to explain the exercise. He mentions that the lift doesn't have to be very high but one should feel the abdominal muscles working.\n9.  **00:33:** While talking about feeling the muscles, the blogger performs a very slight lift of his head and the very top of his shoulders. The range of motion is minimal, and his upper back largely remains on the bench. This movement is significantly smaller than the first sit-up and appears to be an illustrative gesture to emphasize muscle engagement rather than a full repetition of the exercise.\n10. **00:34 - 00:59:** The blogger continues to lie down and explain different aspects of the sit-up, such as hand placement and adjusting the height of the lift. No further movements resembling a complete sit-up (like the one performed between 00:21-00:24) are observed.\n\n**Reasoning for the count:**\nThe primary demonstration of a sit-up movement occurs between 00:21 and 00:24. This involves a clear lift of the upper torso from the bench and a controlled return. This is counted as one sit-up.\nThe very slight lift observed around 00:33 is qualitatively different from the first movement. It has a much smaller range of motion and occurs while the blogger is speaking and gesturing to illustrate a point about muscle sensation. It does not constitute a repetition of the sit-up exercise as demonstrated initially. The rest of the video segment involves explanation without further sit-up repetitions.\n\nTherefore, the blogger completes 1 sit-up movement in the video.\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed 1 sit-up movement.\nThe first and only clear sit-up movement is performed as follows:\n*   Starts lifting at 00:21.\n*   Reaches peak lift at 00:22.\n*   Returns to starting position by 00:24.\n\nNo other movements of comparable range or intent as a sit-up repetition are observed.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{1}$", "predicted_count": 1, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

This suggests a complex movement. A \"squant\" movement will be defined as a full squat: lowering the hips until the thighs are at least parallel to the ground (or as deep as the performer goes) and then returning to a standing position.\n\nLet's analyze the sequence:\n\n1.  **First Squant Movement (Front Squat):**\n    *   **0:00:** The blogger is in a standing position with the barbell in a front rack position (on her shoulders). She begins to descend.\n    *   **~0:00.6:** She reaches the bottom of this squat.\n    *   **~0:01.1:** She returns to a standing position, completing the first squat. This is a front squat. **(Squant Count: 1)**\n\n2.  **Transition to Overhead Position (Jerk/Press):**\n    *   **~0:01.1 - 0:02.0:** After completing the front squat, she presses the barbell overhead (a jerk or push press).\n\n3.  **Second Squant Movement (Overhead Squat):**\n    *   **~0:02.1:** With the bar now overhead, she begins to descend into another squat.\n    *   **~0:02.6:** She reaches the bottom of this overhead squat.\n    *   **~0:03.1:** She returns to a standing position with the bar still overhead, completing the second squat. This is an overhead squat. **(Squant Count: 2)**\n\n4.  **Transition (Lowering Bar and Clean):**\n    *   **~0:03.1 - 0:04.0:** She lowers the bar back to the front rack position.\n    *   **~0:04.0 - 0:05.0:** She lowers the bar from her shoulders to a hang position (around her thighs).\n    *   **~0:05.0 - 0:06.0:** She performs a \"clean\" movement, lifting the bar from the hang position back to the front rack position on her shoulders. No squatting action occurs during this phase.\n\n5.  **Third Squant Movement (Front Squat):**\n    *   **~0:06.1:** Now with the bar back in the front rack position, she begins to descend for another front squat.\n    *   **~0:06.6:** She reaches the bottom of this squat.\n    *   **~0:07.1:** She returns to a standing position, completing the third squat. **(Squant Count: 3)**\n\n6.  **Transition to Overhead Position (Jerk/Press):**\n    *   **~0:07.1 - 0:08.0:** After completing the front squat, she presses the barbell overhead again.\n\n7.  **Fourth Squant Movement (Overhead Squat):**\n    *   **~0:08.1:** With the bar overhead, she begins to descend into an overhead squat.\n    *   **~0:08.6:** She reaches the bottom of this overhead squat.\n    *   **~0:09.0 (end of video):** She is in the process of returning to a standing position or has just completed it as the video ends. We can count this as a completed squat as she has clearly performed the downward and upward phase. **(Squant Count: 4)**\n\nReasoning Summary:\nThe blogger performs a complex movement that involves a front squat, followed by an overhead press (jerk), and then an overhead squat. This entire sequence is then repeated after a clean. Each distinct squatting action (hips down, then hips up) is counted as one \"squant\" movement.\n\n*   Squant 1: Front Squat (completed around 0:01)\n*   Squant 2: Overhead Squat (completed around 0:03)\n*   Squant 3: Front Squat (completed around 0:07)\n*   Squant 4: Overhead Squat (completed around 0:09)\n\nTherefore, the blogger has completed a total of 4 squant movements.\n\n\\boxed{4}", "predicted_count": 4, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

By 0:01, the legs have completed one full rotation. **Movement 1**\n*   **0:01 - 0:02:** Second full circle completed. **Movement 2**\n*   **0:02 - 0:03:** Third full circle completed. **Movement 3**\n*   **0:03 - 0:04:** Fourth full circle completed. **Movement 4**\n*   **0:04 - 0:05:** Fifth full circle completed. **Movement 5**\n*   **0:05 - 0:06:** Sixth full circle completed. **Movement 6**\n*   **0:06 - 0:07:** Seventh full circle completed. **Movement 7**\n*   **0:07 - 0:08:** Eighth full circle completed. **Movement 8**\n*   **0:08 - 0:09:** Ninth full circle completed. **Movement 9**\n*   **0:09 - 0:10:** Tenth full circle completed. **Movement 10**\n*   **0:10 - 0:11:** Eleventh full circle completed. **Movement 11**\n*   **0:11 - 0:12:** Twelfth full circle completed. **Movement 12**\n*   **0:12 - 0:13:** Thirteenth full circle completed. **Movement 13**\n*   **0:13 - 0:14:** Fourteenth full circle completed. **Movement 14**\n*   **0:14 - 0:15:** Fifteenth full circle completed. **Movement 15**\n*   **0:15 - 0:16:** Sixteenth full circle completed. **Movement 16**\n*   **0:16 - 0:17:** Seventeenth full circle completed. **Movement 17**\n*   **0:17 - 0:18:** Eighteenth full circle completed. **Movement 18**\n*   **0:18 - 0:19:** Nineteenth full circle completed. **Movement 19**\n*   **0:19 - 0:20:** Twentieth full circle completed. **Movement 20**\n*   **0:20 - 0:21:** Twenty-first full circle completed. **Movement 21**\n*   **0:21 - 0:22:** Twenty-second full circle completed. **Movement 22**\n*   **0:22 - 0:23:** Twenty-third full circle completed. **Movement 23**\n*   **0:23 - 0:24:** Twenty-fourth full circle completed. **Movement 24**\n*   **0:24 - 0:25:** Twenty-fifth full circle completed. **Movement 25**\n*   **0:25 - 0:26:** Twenty-sixth full circle completed. **Movement 26**\n*   **0:26 - 0:27:** Twenty-seventh full circle completed. **Movement 27**\n*   **0:27 - 0:28:** Twenty-eighth full circle completed. **Movement 28**\n*   **0:28 - 0:29:** Twenty-ninth full circle completed. **Movement 29**\n*   **0:29 - 0:30:** The gymnast performs a final circle and transitions into the dismount. The dismount itself is the final movement. **Movement 30** (Circle leading into and including the dismount)\n*   **0:30:** The gymnast lands.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\nThe gymnast performs a series of continuous circles on the pommel horse. Each complete 360-degree rotation of the legs around the horse is counted as one movement. The routine concludes with a dismount, which is also counted as a movement. By carefully observing the rotation of the legs frame by frame, we can count each completed circle and the final dismount.\n\nTotal movements: 30\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{30}$", "predicted_count": 30, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

I will define a \"pommel horse movement\" for this counting purpose as a full 360-degree circular swing of the legs (either together or in a flair) around the pommel horse, supported by the hands. Transitions to handstands that involve a full circular motion (like a flair to handstand) will also be counted as one movement.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **0:00 - 0:01:** Athlete mounts and begins his first circle.\n2.  **0:01 - 0:02:** First full circle completed.

This flair constitutes one full rotation. (Count: 18)\n21. **0:21 onwards:** Athlete executes the dismount from the handstand. This is the end of the pommel horse circling movements.\n\nBased on this frame-by-frame analysis, counting each full 360-degree circular swing of the legs as one movement:\n\nThe blogger completed 5 standard circles, then 1 flair to handstand, then 11 standard circles, and finally 1 flair to handstand for the dismount.\nTotal = 5 + 1 + 11 + 1 = 18 movements.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe blogger completed 18 pommel horse movements.\n\n1.

He then transitions to a flair sequence, traveling along the horse. Each full 360-degree rotation of the legs during the flair sequence is counted as a movement. He performs 9 such flair rotations. The routine concludes with a handstand dismount, which is not counted as a pommel horse circle/flair.\n\nTotal movements = 11 (circles) + 9 (flairs) = 20.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe blogger (gymnast) completed a total of 20 pommel horse movements (circles and flairs).\n\n\\boxed{20}", "predicted_count": 20, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The \"others movement\" in this context is interpreted as the full body rotations (also known as \"turns\") that the athlete executes to build momentum before releasing the hammer.

The hammer circles around their head, but the body primarily sways and shifts weight, without a full 360-degree pivot of the feet and body.\n    *   Around 00:02 to 00:03, the athlete performs a second preliminary swing (wind), similar to the first.\n    These preliminary swings are not counted as the \"others movements\" (full rotations) for this analysis.\n\n2.  **First Full Rotation (Turn 1):**\n    *   **Start:** At approximately 00:04, the athlete begins the first full body rotation. Their feet start to pivot, and their entire body turns counter-clockwise (from the viewer's perspective) as they swing the hammer.\n    *   **Mid-point:** Around 00:05, the athlete has rotated roughly 180 degrees, with their back facing the initial camera direction.\n    *   **End:** By late 00:05 and into early 00:06, the athlete completes a full 360-degree rotation, returning to a forward-facing orientation (relative to the start of the turn) as the hammer passes in front of them. This marks the completion of the **first** \"others movement\".\n\n3.  **Second Full Rotation (Turn 2):**\n    *   **Start:** Immediately after the first rotation, around early 00:06, the athlete transitions into the second full body rotation.\n    *   **Mid-point:** Around mid-00:06, the athlete has again rotated approximately 180 degrees within this turn.\n    *   **End:** By late 00:06 and into early 00:07, the athlete completes the second full 360-degree rotation. This marks the completion of the **second** \"others movement\".\n\n4.  **Third Full Rotation (Turn 3):**\n    *   **Start:** Immediately after the second rotation, around early 00:07, the athlete begins the third full body rotation.\n    *   **Mid-point:** Around mid-00:07, the athlete has rotated approximately 180 degrees within this turn.\n    *   **End:** By late 00:07 and into early 00:08, the athlete completes the third full 360-degree rotation. This marks the completion of the **third** \"others movement\".\n\n5.  **Fourth Full Rotation (Turn 4):**\n    *   **Start:** Immediately after the third rotation, around early 00:08, the athlete begins the fourth and final full body rotation.\n    *   **Mid-point:** Around mid-00:08, the athlete has rotated approximately 180 degrees within this turn.\n    *   **End:** By late 00:08 and into early 00:09, the athlete completes the fourth full 360-degree rotation. The hammer is released during the latter part of this rotation, as the athlete faces the throwing direction. This marks the completion of the **fourth** \"others movement\".\n\n6.  **Release (00:09):**\n    *   At 00:09, the hammer is visibly released and in the air. No further rotations are performed.\n\nBased on this frame-by-frame analysis, the athlete completes four distinct full body rotations (turns) after the initial preliminary swings and before releasing the hammer.\n\nFinal Count:\n*   Rotation 1: Completed by early 00:06\n*   Rotation 2: Completed by early 00:07\n*   Rotation 3: Completed by early 00:08\n*   Rotation 4: Completed by early 00:09 (coinciding with release)\n\nTotal number of completed \"others movements\" (full body rotations) is 4.\n\n\\boxed{4}", "predicted_count": 4, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

Her body starts rotating counter-clockwise, and her feet begin to move. The hammer is typically at its lowest point in front or moving towards the back of the circle relative to her body.\n    *   **Mid-point:** Around 00:07 (e.g., 00:07.2), the athlete has rotated approximately 180 degrees, with her back facing the initial direction (towards the camera in this view).\n    *   **Completion:** Around 00:08 (e.g., 00:08.0), the athlete completes the first 360-degree rotation. Her body is again facing the initial general direction (or the direction of the throw), and the hammer passes its lowest point in front of her.

I will define a \"pommel horse movement\" for the purpose of this count as a full 360-degree circle of the legs around the horse, supported by the hands, typically starting and ending with the legs in a similar orientation (e.g., legs forward).\n\nThe primary performance by the gymnast occurs from the beginning of the video until approximately 0:08, after which he lands his dismount. The subsequent footage is a replay. We will only count the movements in the initial performance.\n\nHere's the step-by-step analysis:\n\n1.  **0:00 - 0:01:** The gymnast is already in motion. He completes his first full circle with his legs extended, passing the front of the horse around the 0:01 mark.\n    *   **Movement 1 completed at ~0:01.**\n\n2.  **0:01 - 0:02:** He immediately goes into another circle.

His legs pass the front of the horse, completing the third circle around the 0:03 mark.\n    *   **Movement 3 completed at ~0:03.**\n\n4.  **0:03 - 0:04:** The gymnast performs a traveling movement. He does a flair-like motion, shifting his body and hands along the length of the horse towards the end. This is a transition/traveling skill, not a simple circle in place. We are counting full circular swings.\n\n5.  **0:04 - 0:05:** Now positioned on the end of the horse (without pommels), he performs a circle. His legs pass the front (over the end of the horse), completing the circle around the 0:05 mark.\n    *   **Movement 4 completed at ~0:05.**\n\n6.  **0:05 - 0:06:** He performs another circle on the end of the horse. His legs pass the front again, completing the circle around the 0:06 mark.\n    *   **Movement 5 completed at ~0:06.**\n\n7.  **0:06 - 0:07:** A third circle is performed on the end of the horse. His legs pass the front, completing this circle around the 0:07 mark.\n    *   **Movement 6 completed at ~0:07.**\n\n8.  **0:07 - 0:08:** The gymnast executes his dismount. This involves a swing to handstand and a twist. This is a dismount skill, not a repetitive circle. He lands around 0:08.\n\nThe footage from 0:09 onwards is a slow-motion replay of the same routine and should not be counted as additional movements.\n\nTherefore, counting the full 360-degree circular swings:\n*   Three circles on the pommels.\n*   Three circles on the end of the horse.\n\nTotal movements = 3 + 3 = 6.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe gymnast completes 3 circles on the main body of the pommel horse (between the pommels) and then, after a traveling element, completes 3 more circles on the end of the horse before his dismount.\n1.

In the context of a hammer throw, the primary movements after the initial preliminary swings are the full-body rotations, commonly referred to as \"turns.\" These turns are executed to accelerate the hammer before release. We will count each completed turn.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis of the video:**\n\n1.  **00:00 - 00:03**: The athlete is standing in the throwing circle, preparing for the throw. No rotational movements are performed yet.\n2.  **00:04 - 00:05**: The athlete begins preliminary swings. These are back-and-forth swings of the hammer, primarily using the arms and upper body, while the feet remain relatively stationary. These preliminary swings are used to build initial momentum and rhythm but are generally not counted as the main \"turns\" or \"rotations\" of the throw. In this video, the athlete performs approximately two such preliminary swings.\n3.  **Start of the first turn (Movement 1)**:\n    *   Around **00:05.0**, the athlete transitions from the preliminary swings into the first full-body rotation. The athlete's feet begin to move, and the entire body starts to rotate counter-clockwise (as viewed from above).\n    *   **Completion of the first turn**: Around **00:07.0**, the athlete completes the first full 360-degree rotation. At this point, the hammer passes its lowest point in front of the athlete, and they are positioned to begin the next turn. This marks the completion of the **first movement**.\n\n4.  **Start of the second turn (Movement 2)**:\n    *   Immediately after completing the first turn (around **00:07.0**), the athlete begins the second full-body rotation.\n    *   **Completion of the second turn**: Around **00:09.0**, the athlete completes the second full 360-degree rotation. Again, the hammer passes its lowest point in front of the athlete. This marks the completion of the **second movement**.\n\n5.  **Start of the third turn (Movement 3)**:\n    *   Immediately after completing the second turn (around **00:09.0**), the athlete begins the third full-body rotation.\n    *   **Completion of the third turn**: Around **00:11.0**, the athlete completes the third full 360-degree rotation, with the hammer once again passing its lowest point in front. This marks the completion of the **third movement**.\n\n6.  **Start of the fourth turn (Movement 4 - Release Turn)**:\n    *   Immediately after completing the third turn (around **00:11.0**), the athlete begins the fourth and final full-body rotation.\n    *   **Completion of the fourth turn**: This turn is different as it culminates in the release of the hammer. The athlete continues to rotate and accelerate the hammer.\n        *   At **00:11.5**, the athlete is well into the rotation.\n        *   Around **00:11.7 - 00:11.8**, the athlete releases the hammer. The act of successfully releasing the hammer signifies the completion of this final turn as part of the overall throw. The video shows the athlete going through this final rotation and the release phase.\n    *   This marks the completion of the **fourth movement**.\n\n**Summary of Movements:**\nThe athlete performs preliminary swings (not counted as the \"others movements\" in question) followed by four distinct full-body rotations (turns).\n", "predicted_count": null, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The 37th circle was the last one fully completed before the video cut.\n\n**Reasoning:**\nEach count corresponds to a full 360-degree rotation of the gymnast's legs around the pommel horse. I used the position where his legs are extended to his right side (relative to his body) as the completion point for each circle. The gymnast maintains a fairly consistent rhythm for the first 20 circles, then slightly adjusts as he travels along the horse, but each subsequent rotation is still clearly a full circle. The 37th circle is completed just before the video ends at 0:38.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe blogger has completed a total of 37 pommel horse movements.\n\n\\boxed{37}", "predicted_count": 37, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

We define a completed movement as a full 360-degree rotation of the athlete's body after the initial wind-up phase.\n\n**Step-by-step analysis:**\n\n1.  **Initial Phase (Winds): 00:00 - 00:02**\n    *   At 00:00, the athlete is relatively stationary, beginning to swing the hammer.\n    *   From 00:00 to 00:02, the athlete performs preliminary swings (winds) to build momentum. During these winds, the hammer revolves around the athlete's head, and there is some body rotation, but these are not the full, dynamic body turns that constitute the main part of the throw's acceleration phase. These initial winds are preparatory and are not counted as the \"others movements\" we are looking for.\n    *   Around 00:02, the athlete transitions from the winds into the first full body turn.\n\n2.  **First Completed Movement (Turn 1): Approximately 00:02 - 00:03.7**\n    *   The first full body rotation begins around 00:02. We can use the athlete's chest facing generally towards the camera (or slightly to their right) as a reference point for the start and completion of a turn.\n    *   At 00:02, the athlete is turning to their left, away from the camera.\n    *   By 00:03, the athlete is facing mostly to their left (from the camera's perspective).\n    *   Around **00:03.7**, the athlete completes a full 360-degree rotation, and their chest is once again facing generally forward/slightly right relative to the camera. This marks the completion of the **first movement**.\n\n3.  **Second Completed Movement (Turn 2): Approximately 00:03.7 - 00:05.5**\n    *   Immediately after completing the first turn, the athlete begins the second full body rotation from approximately 00:03.7.\n    *   At 00:04, the athlete is rotating, facing forward/right.\n    *   At 00:05, the athlete is facing to their left.\n    *   Around **00:05.5**, the athlete completes the second full 360-degree rotation, returning to the forward/slightly right facing orientation. This marks the completion of the **second movement**.\n\n4.  **Third Completed Movement (Turn 3): Approximately 00:05.5 - 00:07.4**\n    *   Starting from the completion of the second turn (around 00:05.5), the athlete initiates the third full body rotation.\n    *   At 00:06, the athlete is rotating, facing forward/right.\n    *   At 00:07, the athlete is facing to their left.\n    *   Around **00:07.4**, the athlete completes the third full 360-degree rotation, again returning to the forward/slightly right facing orientation. This marks the completion of the **third movement**.\n\n5.  **Fourth Movement (Turn 4 - Incomplete): Approximately 00:07.4 - 00:08 (video ends)**\n    *   After completing the third turn (around 00:07.4), the athlete begins the fourth full body rotation.\n    *   At 00:08, the video ends. At this point, the athlete is in the middle of this fourth rotation. Their body is turning, and they are looking towards the direction of the throw (generally to their left from the camera's initial perspective). They have not completed a full 360-degree turn from the start of this fourth movement before the video cuts off. Therefore, this movement is not counted as completed.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the frame-by-frame analysis, the blogger has completed 3 full \"others movements\" (full body rotations/turns) in the video. The fourth rotation is initiated but not completed within the duration of the video.\n\nThe blogger has completed 3 \"others movements\".\n\n\\boxed{3}", "predicted_count": 3, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

His thighs are well below parallel to the ground. This is the bottom phase of a squat.\n2.  **00:01 - 00:03:** The blogger begins to ascend from this deep squat position. His hips are rising, and his legs are straightening.\n3.  **00:04:** The blogger reaches a fully standing position on the rail. His legs are straight.

His thighs appear to be parallel to the ground or slightly below.\n7.  **00:09 (latter part of the second):** The blogger begins to ascend from this second squat. His hips start to rise.\n8.  **End of video (00:09):** The video cuts off while the blogger is still in the upward phase of this second squat. He has not yet returned to a fully standing position. Therefore, this second squat movement is **not completed** within the duration of the video.\n\nReasoning Summary:\n*   The first movement observed is the blogger rising from a full squat position (seen at 00:00) to a full standing position (achieved by 00:04). This is counted as one completed squat.\n*   The second movement starts with the blogger going down into a squat (00:08) and beginning to rise (00:09), but the video ends before he fully stands up again. This squat is therefore incomplete.\n\nBased on this analysis, the blogger has completed 1 squat movement in total within the video.\n\n\\boxed{1}", "predicted_count": 1, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The blogger lands from the 13th jump around 0:27.0 and is standing by 0:27.5)\n\nMy second, more careful pass suggests 13. Let's review the transition from the last jump to the rest period.\nThe 13th jump occurs, and the blogger lands around 0:27.0. The audio cue for \"REST\" happens at 0:27.3. The visual cue \"10 SECONDS REST\" appears at 0:27.8. The 13th jump is completed before the rest period is fully signaled.\n\nLet's list the times the feet leave the ground for the jump (marking the completion of the upward phase of the squat):\n1.  ~0:08.9\n2.  ~0:10.3\n3.  ~0:11.7\n4.  ~0:13.2\n5.  ~0:14.7\n6.  ~0:16.2\n7.  ~0:17.6\n8.  ~0:19.1\n9.  ~0:20.6\n10. ~0:22.1\n11. ~0:23.6\n12. ~0:25.1\n13. ~0:26.6\n\nThe work period is \"20 SECONDS WORK\".\nIt starts at 0:07.5. So it should end at 0:27.5.\nThe 13th jump (feet leave ground at 0:26.6) is well within this 20-second window. The blogger lands from this jump around 0:27.0. The audio \"REST\" cue is at 0:27.3.\n\nSo, the 13th squat jump is completed within the 20-second work interval.\n\nFinal check:\nThe exercise starts when \"POWER JUMPS 20 SECONDS WORK\" appears at 0:07.\nThe exercise ends when \"10 SECONDS REST\" appears at 0:27 (and the audio cue \"REST\" is heard).\n\n1.  Squat down (0:08), jump up (0:09)\n2.  Squat down (0:09), jump up (0:10)\n3.  Squat down (0:11), jump up (0:12)\n4.  Squat down (0:12), jump up (0:13)\n5.  Squat down (0:14), jump up (0:15)\n6.  Squat down (0:15), jump up (0:16)\n7.  Squat down (0:17), jump up (0:17) - this one is faster\n8.  Squat down (0:18), jump up (0:19)\n9.  Squat down (0:19), jump up (0:20)\n10. Squat down (0:21), jump up (0:22)\n11. Squat down (0:22), jump up (0:23)\n12. Squat down (0:24), jump up (0:25)\n13. Squat down (0:25), jump up (0:26) - The jump happens, and he lands around 0:27, just as \"REST\" is called.\n\nThe 13th jump is initiated (he is in the air) before the \"REST\" cue at 0:27. The landing from the 13th jump coincides with the start of the rest period. So, 13 full squat jumps were completed.\n\nReasoning:\n1.  The exercise \"POWER JUMPS 20 SECONDS WORK\" begins at approximately 0:07.\n2.  A squat movement is defined as the blogger lowering into a squat position and then explosively jumping upwards.\n3.  The first squat jump is completed (landing after the jump) around 0:09.\n4.

The blogger is in the air from this jump as the 20-second work period ends and the \"REST\" cue is given at 0:27. The landing from this 13th jump occurs right at the transition to the rest period. Since the upward phase (the jump) was initiated and largely completed within the work period, it counts.\n5.  The \"REST\" period begins at 0:27.\n\nThe blogger completed 13 squat movements.\n\n\\boxed{13}", "predicted_count": 13, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

This counts as the 20th completed upward phase.\n\nReasoning:\nThe exercise performed is a hip raise, not a situp. Each repetition is counted when the blogger lifts his hips off the mat and then lowers them back down. I have tracked each instance of this upward and downward motion. The timer in the video starts at 30 seconds and counts down. The first hip raise movement begins when the timer shows 29 seconds, and the 20th upward movement is completed as the timer reaches 00.\n\nBased on this analysis of the hip raise movements:\nThe blogger completed a total of 20 hip raise movements. If the question strictly refers to \"situp movements\" as traditionally defined, then the answer would be 0, as no traditional situps were performed. However, assuming the question refers to the exercise being demonstrated, the count is 20.\n\nGiven the instruction to count \"situp movements\" but the video showing \"Hips raises,\" I will provide the count for the exercise shown.\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed 20 repetitions of the exercise shown (which are hip raises, not situps).\n\n\\boxed{20}", "predicted_count": 20, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

A complete jumping jack typically involves two phases:\n1.  **Outward phase:** Starting with feet together and arms by the sides, the person jumps to a position with the legs spread wide and the hands moving overhead (often clapping or nearly touching).\n2.  **Inward phase:** The person jumps back to the starting position with feet together and arms by the sides.\n\nOne completed jumping jack is the full cycle from the starting position, through the outward phase, and back to the starting position.\n\nLet's analyze the video frame by frame, paying attention to the on-screen counter as a reference, but counting the physical movements.\n\n*   **00:00:** The blogger is in the starting position (feet together, arms at sides). The on-screen counter shows \"60 / 0\".\n*   **00:01 (early):** The blogger performs the outward phase (legs apart, arms moving up/out). As his arms reach their widest/highest point, the on-screen counter changes to \"60 / 1\".\n*   **00:01 (late):** The blogger performs the inward phase, returning to the starting position. This completes the **1st** jumping jack.\n*   **00:02 (early):** Outward phase. On-screen counter changes to \"60 / 2\".\n*   **00:02 (late):** Inward phase. This completes the **2nd** jumping jack.\n*   **00:03 (early):** Outward phase. On-screen counter changes to \"60 / 3\".\n*   **00:03 (late):** Inward phase. This completes the **3rd** jumping jack.\n\nThis pattern continues. The on-screen counter increments when the blogger reaches the peak of the outward phase (legs apart, arms up). A full jumping jack is completed when he returns to the starting position after this. So, when the counter shows 'N', he is in the middle of the Nth jumping jack, and completes it by returning to the start.\n\nLet's follow this logic through the video:\n\n*   ... (movements continue consistently)\n*   **00:08:** The counter shows \"60 / 9\" during the outward phase. He returns to the start, completing the **8th** jack. (Note: The counter seems to jump from 7 to 9 here, but the physical movement for the 8th jack is completed as the counter shows 9). Let's re-examine this specific transition.\n    *   00:07 (early): Counter shows 7 (outward). Returns to start (7th jack complete).\n    *   00:07 (late): Counter shows 8 (outward).\n    *   00:08 (early): Returns to start (8th jack complete).\n    *   00:08 (mid): Counter shows 9 (outward).\n    *   00:08 (late): Returns to start (9th jack complete).\n    It seems the counter is consistent with the outward phase. My previous note was a misinterpretation of the counter jump. The counter increments with each outward phase.\n\nLet's continue tracking based on the completion of the movement after the counter increments:\n*   When counter shows 1, he completes jack 1.\n*   When counter shows 2, he completes jack 2.\n*   ...\n*   When counter shows 10 (at 00:09), he completes jack 10.\n*   ...\n*   When counter shows 20 (at 00:18), he completes jack 20.\n*   ...\n*   When counter shows 30 (at 00:28), he completes jack 30.\n*   ...\n*   When counter shows 40 (at 00:37), he completes jack 40.\n*   ...\n*   When counter shows 50 (at 00:46), he completes jack 50.\n*   ...\n\nNow let's look at the end of the video:\n*   **00:51 (early):** Outward phase. On-screen counter changes to \"60 / 56\".\n*   **00:51 (late):** Inward phase. This completes the **56th** jumping jack.\n*   **00:52 (early):** Outward phase. On-screen counter changes to \"60 / 57\".\n*   **00:52 (late):** Inward phase. This completes the **57th** jumping jack.\n*   **00:53 (early):** Outward phase. On-screen counter changes to \"60 / 58\".\n*   **00:53 (late) - 00:54 (start):** Inward phase. The blogger returns to the starting position. This completes the **58th** jumping jack.\n*   **00:54 - 00:58 (end of video):** The blogger remains in the starting position. The counter stays at \"60 / 58\". No further movements are made.\n\nTherefore, the blogger has completed 58 jumping jack movements. The on-screen counter accurately reflects the number of the jack that is completed when the blogger returns to the starting position.\n\nFinal count:\nThe blogger completes a jumping jack each time he returns to the \"feet together, arms down\" position.

The video displays a few exercises. The prompt states, \"This is a video of a video blogger performing the front raise movement.\" We will interpret the initial exercise shown, an overhead press with the barbell starting from the front of the body (chest/shoulder level) and pressed upwards, as the \"front raise movement\" in question, as it heavily engages the anterior (front) deltoids. The later segments show a \"Behind the Neck Shoulder Press,\" which is a distinct exercise and not a \"front\" raise.\n\nA \"completed movement\" or repetition is defined as performing the full range of motion for the exercise, which for a press typically involves an upward (concentric) phase and a downward (eccentric) phase, returning to the starting position.\n\nLet's analyze the video frame by frame for the overhead press from the front, which occurs from 0:00 to 0:17:\n\n1.  **Movement 1:**\n    *   **0:01:** The blogger starts with the barbell at chest level.\n    *   **0:02:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   **0:03:** The barbell is lowered back to the chest level.\n    *   This constitutes one completed movement.\n\n2.  **Movement 2:**\n    *   **0:04:** The blogger starts the next repetition from chest level.\n    *   **0:05:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   **0:06:** The barbell is lowered back to the chest level.\n    *   This constitutes a second completed movement.\n\n3.  **Movement 3:**\n    *   **0:07:** The blogger starts the next repetition from chest level.\n    *   **0:08:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   **0:09:** The barbell is lowered back to the chest level.\n    *   This constitutes a third completed movement.\n\n4.  **Movement 4:**\n    *   **0:10:** The blogger starts the next repetition from chest level.\n    *   **0:11:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   **0:12:** The barbell is lowered back to the chest level.\n    *   This constitutes a fourth completed movement.\n\n5.  **Movement 5:**\n    *   **0:13:** The blogger starts the next repetition from chest level.\n    *   **0:14:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   **0:15:** The barbell is lowered back to the chest level.\n    *   This constitutes a fifth completed movement.\n\n6.  **Movement 6 (Attempt):**\n    *   **0:16:** The blogger starts the next repetition from chest level.\n    *   **0:17:** The barbell is pressed fully overhead.\n    *   The video scene changes at 0:18. The downward phase of this repetition (lowering the bar back to the chest) is not shown to be completed before the cut.

We will use the on-screen counter as a reference and verify its accuracy by observing the movements.\n\nA complete push-up movement consists of:\n1.  Starting in a plank position with arms extended.\n2.  Lowering the body until the chest is close to the floor (or elbows bend to at least 90 degrees).\n3.  Pushing the body back up to the starting position with arms fully extended.\n\nThe on-screen counter appears to increment *after* a push-up is completed.\n\nLet's track the push-ups based on the on-screen counter and the movement:\n\n*   **0:00:** The video starts. The on-screen counter shows **34**. The blogger is in the \"up\" position. This implies 33 push-ups were completed before the video segment, and the 34th is either just completed or about to be performed. Given the counter usually updates *after* completion, it's more likely he is at the top of the 34th, or the counter is about to update for the 34th. However, standard practice is that the number shown is the one *just completed* or the *next one to be done*. Let's assume the counter updates *after* the rep. So, when it shows 34, 34 reps are done. The *next* movement will make it 35.\n    Alternatively, if the counter shows \"34\" and he is at the top, the movement from 0:00 to 0:01 is the 34th pushup. Let's watch the first increment.\n\n*   **0:00 - 0:01:** The blogger performs one push-up (down and up).\n*   **0:01:** The counter changes from 34 to **35**. This means the push-up completed at 0:01 was the 35th push-up. So, at the very start (0:00), 34 push-ups had been completed.\n\nLet's list the completions based on when the counter increments:\n1.  **0:01:** Counter becomes **35**. (1st push-up in this video segment)\n2.  **0:03:** Counter becomes **36**. (2nd push-up)\n3.  **0:05:** Counter becomes **37**. (3rd push-up)\n4.  **0:08:** Counter becomes **38**. (4th push-up)\n5.  **0:10:** Counter becomes **39**. (5th push-up)\n6.  **0:12:** Counter becomes **40**. (6th push-up)\n7.  **0:14:** Counter becomes **41**. (7th push-up)\n8.  **0:16:** Counter becomes **42**. (8th push-up)\n9.  **0:17-0:18:** Counter becomes **43**. (9th push-up)\n10. **0:19-0:20:** Counter becomes **44**. (10th push-up)\n11. **0:21-0:22:** Counter becomes **45**. (11th push-up)\n12. **0:23-0:24:** Counter becomes **46**. (12th push-up)\n13. **0:25-0:26:** Counter becomes **47**. (13th push-up)\n14. **0:27-0:28:** Counter becomes **48**. (14th push-up)\n15. **0:29-0:30:** Counter becomes **49**. (15th push-up)\n16. **0:31-0:32:** Counter becomes **50**. (16th push-up)\n17. **0:33-0:34:** Counter becomes **51**. (17th push-up)\n18. **0:35-0:36:** Counter becomes **52**. (18th push-up)\n19. **0:37-0:38:** Counter becomes **53**. (19th push-up)\n20. **0:40-0:41:** Counter becomes **54**. (20th push-up)\n\nThe video ends shortly after the counter turns to 54, with the blogger in the \"up\" position of the 54th push-up.\nThe on-screen counter accurately reflects each completed push-up.\nThe first push-up shown in the video is the one that brings the count to 35.\nThe last push-up shown in the video is the one that brings the count to 54.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of push-up movements the blogger has completed *in total*. Based on the on-screen counter, which we have verified is tracking each valid push-up, the total number completed by the end of the video is 54.\n\nThe number of push-ups performed *during this video clip* is 54 (final count) - 34 (initial count before the first rep in the clip) = 20 push-ups.\nHowever, the question \"completed in total\" refers to the cumulative count shown.\n\nFinal check:\n- At 0:00, counter is 34. The person is at the top. This means 34 push-ups are already done.\n- The movement from 0:00 to 0:01 is the 35th push-up. At 0:01, the counter updates to 35.\n- This pattern continues. Each time the blogger completes a push-up (returns to the top position), the counter increments.\n- The last completed push-up occurs leading up to 0:41, at which point the counter shows 54.\n\nSo, the blogger has completed 54 push-ups in total by the end of this video segment.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  The video starts with an on-screen counter at 34, and the individual is in the top position of a push-up. This indicates that 34 push-ups have been completed prior to the next movement shown.\n2.  The first push-up movement observed in the video (lowering and then raising the body) is completed at approximately 0:01. Simultaneously, the on-screen counter increments to 35.

A complete barbell squat movement is defined as the blogger starting from a standing position with the barbell on their back, lowering their hips (eccentric phase) until their thighs are at least parallel to the ground, and then returning to the initial standing position (concentric phase).\n\nHere is a step-by-step count of the barbell squat movements:\n\n**Set 1 (0:00 - 0:24)**\nThe blogger unracks the barbell at 0:00.\n1.  **Rep 1**: Descent begins at 0:01, ascent is completed by 0:02.\n2.  **Rep 2**: Descent begins at 0:03, ascent is completed by 0:05.\n3.  **Rep 3**: Descent begins at 0:07, ascent is completed by 0:10.\n4.  **Rep 4**: Descent begins at 0:12, ascent is completed by 0:15.\n5.  **Rep 5**: Descent begins at 0:17, ascent is completed by 0:19.\n6.  **Rep 6**: Descent begins at 0:20 (the camera angle changes at 0:21 during the descent), ascent is completed by 0:23.\nThe blogger reracks the barbell at 0:24.\n*Total squats after Set 1: 6*\n\n**Set 2 (0:26 - 0:43)**\nThe blogger unracks the barbell at 0:26 (after a brief pause and camera angle change).\n7.  **Rep 7 (Set 2, Rep 1)**: Descent begins at 0:27, ascent is completed by 0:28.\n8.  **Rep 8 (Set 2, Rep 2)**: Descent begins at 0:29, ascent is completed by 0:30.\n9.  **Rep 9 (Set 2, Rep 3)**: Descent begins at 0:32, ascent is completed by 0:33.\n10. **Rep 10 (Set 2, Rep 4)**: Descent begins at 0:34, ascent is completed by 0:36.\n11. **Rep 11 (Set 2, Rep 5)**: Descent begins at 0:37, ascent is completed by 0:38.\n12. **Rep 12 (Set 2, Rep 6)**: Descent begins at 0:40, ascent is completed by 0:42.\nThe blogger reracks the barbell at 0:43.\n*Total squats after Set 2: 12*\n\n**Set 3 (0:47 - 0:59)**\nThe blogger unracks the barbell at 0:47 (after a brief pause and another camera angle change).\n13. **Rep 13 (Set 3, Rep 1)**: Descent begins at 0:48, ascent is completed by 0:49.\n14. **Rep 14 (Set 3, Rep 2)**: Descent begins at 0:50, ascent is completed by 0:51.\n15. **Rep 15", "predicted_count": null, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

His legs are to his right, swing forward, then to his left, then to the back. By approximately 0:01 (mid-second), his legs are back over the right side, completing the **first** circle.\n2.  **0:01 - 0:02:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:02 (mid-second), legs are over the right side again. **Second** circle complete.\n3.  **0:02 - 0:03:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:03 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Third** circle complete.\n4.  **0:03 - 0:04:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:04 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Fourth** circle complete.\n5.  **0:04 - 0:05:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:05 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Fifth** circle complete.\n6.  **0:05 - 0:06:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:06 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Sixth** circle complete.\n7.  **0:06 - 0:07:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:07 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Seventh** circle complete.\n8.  **0:07 - 0:08:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:08 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Eighth** circle complete.\n9.  **0:08 - 0:09:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:09 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Ninth** circle complete.\n10. **0:09 - 0:10:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:10 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Tenth** circle complete.\n11. **0:10 - 0:11:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:11 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Eleventh** circle complete.\n12. **0:11 - 0:12:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:12 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Twelfth** circle complete.\n\n    *Transition (0:12 - 0:16):* The gymnast now transitions into a flair-like movement and travels down the horse. This is a different type of skill, not a series of the same discrete circles as before. I will not count each leg pass during the flair travel as a separate \"circle\" in the same way as the initial movements, as it's a continuous traveling skill.\n\n13. **0:17 - 0:18:** After the travel, he resumes circles at the end of the horse. Legs swing from right, forward, left, back. By approximately 0:18 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Thirteenth** circle complete.\n14. **0:18 - 0:19:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:19 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Fourteenth** circle complete.\n15. **0:19 - 0:20:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:20 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Fifteenth** circle complete.\n16. **0:20 - 0:21:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:21 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Sixteenth** circle complete.\n17. **0:21 - 0:22:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:22 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Seventeenth** circle complete.\n18. **0:22 - 0:23:** Legs swing forward, left, back. By approximately 0:23 (mid-second), legs are over the right side. **Eighteenth** circle complete.\n\n    *Dismount (0:23 onwards):* The gymnast then initiates his dismount sequence, which involves a flair to handstand and a twist. This is a single, complex dismount skill, not a series of countable circles.\n\nBased on counting each full 360-degree circular swing of the legs as one movement, the gymnast completed 18 such movements.\n\nFinal Answer: The blogger completed 18 pommel horse movements (circles).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  A \"pommel horse movement\" is defined as one complete 360-degree rotation (circle) of the legs around the horse.\n2.  The first set of circles occurs from 0:00 to 0:12.\n    *   Circle 1 completed by ~0:01\n    *   Circle 2 completed by ~0:02\n    *   Circle 3 completed by ~0:03\n    *   Circle 4 completed by ~0:04\n    *   Circle 5 completed by ~0:05\n    *   Circle 6 completed by ~0:06\n    *   Circle 7 completed by ~0:07\n    *   Circle 8 completed by ~0:08\n    *   Circle 9 completed by ~0:09\n    *   Circle 10 completed by ~0:10\n    *   Circle 11 completed by ~0:11\n    *   Circle 12 completed by ~0:12\n3.  From 0:12 to 0:16, the gymnast performs a flair travel, which is a continuous skill and not counted as individual circles in this context.\n4.  The second set of circles occurs from 0:17 to 0:23 at the end of the horse.\n    *   Circle 13 completed by ~0:18\n    *   Circle 14 completed by ~0:19\n    *   Circle 15 completed by ~0:20\n    *   Circle 16 completed by ~0:21\n    *   Circle 17 completed by ~0:22\n    *   Circle 18 completed by ~0:23\n5.  From 0:23 onwards, the gymnast performs his dismount.\n\nTotal count of full circles = 12 (first set) + 6 (second set) = 18.\n\n\\boxed{18}", "predicted_count": 18, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

To do this, we need to carefully analyze the video frame by frame to identify the exercise being performed and then count the repetitions if it is indeed a bench press.\n\n**Step-by-step reasoning:**\n\n1.  **Understanding the Request:** The request is to count \"bench pressing movements.\"\n\n2.  **Initial Observation of the Video:**\n    *   The video shows an individual in a gym setting performing an exercise with a barbell.\n    *   There are two distinct segments showing weightlifting. The first is from 0:00 to 0:16, and the second is from 0:17 to 0:33.\n\n3.  **Detailed Analysis of the Exercise Performed (Segment 1: 0:00 - 0:16):**\n    *   At 0:00, the individual (wearing a white tank top and headphones) is in a bent-over position, with the barbell on or very close to the floor in front of them.\n    *   From 0:00 to 0:01, the individual lifts the barbell by extending their hips and knees, straightening their back, until they are standing upright with the barbell held in front of their thighs.\n    *   From 0:01 to 0:02, the individual lowers the barbell back towards the floor by bending at the hips and knees, returning to a bent-over position.\n    *   This sequence of lifting the barbell from the floor to a standing position and then lowering it is repeated.\n    *   This exercise is characteristic of a **deadlift**.\n\n4.  **Detailed Analysis of the Exercise Performed (Segment 2: 0:17 - 0:33):**\n    *   At 0:17, the camera angle changes, and an individual (wearing a black long-sleeve shirt, possibly the same person or a different one) is shown performing a similar exercise.\n    *   The individual starts with the barbell on or near the floor.\n    *   They lift the barbell to a standing position (e.g., 0:17 to 0:19).\n    *   They then lower the barbell back towards the floor (e.g., 0:19 to 0:20).\n    *   This exercise is also characteristic of a **deadlift**.\n\n5.  **Definition of a Bench Pressing Movement:**\n    A bench press is an upper-body strength training exercise that involves:\n    *   Lying supine (on the back) on a bench.\n    *   Gripping a barbell (or dumbbells) with both hands.\n    *   Lowering the weight to the level of the chest.\n    *   Pressing the weight upwards until the arms are fully extended.\n\n6.  **Comparison of Observed Exercise with Bench Press Definition:**\n    *   The exercise shown in the video involves the individual standing and lifting a barbell from the floor.\n    *   At no point in the video is the individual lying on a bench.\n    *   At no point is the individual pressing a weight upwards from their chest while in a supine position.\n    *   The movements performed are consistent with the definition of a deadlift, not a bench press.\n\n7.  **Conclusion on the Count of Bench Pressing Movements:**\n    Since the video exclusively shows the performance of deadlifts and does not contain any bench pressing movements, the number of bench pressing movements completed by the blogger is zero. The text overlays \"215lbs x 5\" and \"225lbs x 5\" refer to the repetitions of the deadlift exercise being performed.\n\nTherefore, based on the visual evidence and the definition of the exercises, the blogger does not perform any bench pressing movements in this video.\n\nThe video shows the blogger performing deadlifts.\n*   In the first segment (0:00-0:16), the blogger completes 5 deadlift repetitions.\n*   In the second segment (0:17-0:33), the blogger completes 5 deadlift repetitions.\nHowever, the question specifically asks for the count of **bench pressing movements**.\n\nFinal Answer: The video shows the blogger performing deadlifts, not bench presses. A bench press involves lying on a bench and pressing a weight up from the chest. A deadlift involves lifting a weight from the floor to a standing position. Since no bench pressing movements are shown in the video, the count is 0.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{0}$", "predicted_count": 0, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The video ends at 00:59 while he is still in the \"out\" phase of this jack. He has not returned to the starting position. Therefore, this jack is not completed.\n\n**Reasoning Summary:**\nEach jumping jack is counted when the blogger returns to the starting position (feet together, arms at sides) after having performed the \"out\" phase (feet apart, arms overhead).\n\n1.  Completed by ~00:04\n2.  Completed by ~00:13\n3.  Completed by ~00:21\n4.  Completed by ~00:29\n5.  Completed by ~00:37\n6.  Completed by ~00:45\n7.  Completed by ~00:53\n8.  The 8th jack is initiated but not completed as the video ends with his arms up and legs apart.\n\nTherefore, the blogger has completed 7 jumping jacks.\n\n\\boxed{7}", "predicted_count": 7, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

No jumping jacks.\n*   **00:07 - 00:11:** The blogger starts a different movement. It looks like a form of jogging in place or skipping, with arms swinging forward and back, but not the characteristic out-and-up motion of a jumping jack, nor are the legs spreading wide. This is not a jumping jack.\n\nTherefore, the blogger completed 3 jumping jacks.\n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n1.  **Movement 1 (00:00-00:01):** Starts with feet together, arms down. Jumps feet apart and arms up, then jumps feet together and arms down. This is one complete jumping jack.\n2.  **Movement 2 (00:01-00:02):** Repeats the sequence: feet apart/arms up, then feet together/arms down. This is the second complete jumping jack.\n3.  **Movement 3 (00:02-00:03):** Repeats the sequence again: feet apart/arms up, then feet together/arms down. This is the third complete jumping jack.\n4.  **Cessation of Movement (00:04):** The blogger clearly stops performing jumping jacks and takes a brief rest.\n5.  **Different Movement (00:07 onwards):** The subsequent movements are not jumping jacks as they do not involve the legs jumping out wide simultaneously with arms going overhead.\n\nBased on this analysis, the blogger completed 3 jumping jacks.\n\n\\boxed{3}", "predicted_count": 3, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

This is a complex sequence involving flairs and a twist to land. We count this entire dismount sequence as one movement. **Movement 36.**\n\nSumming these up, the gymnast has completed 36 pommel horse movements.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe gymnast completed a total of 36 pommel horse movements.\nThe breakdown is as follows:\n- Circles (non-traveling, not part of spindles): 17\n- Flair to handstand: 1\n- Spindles/Magyars: 2\n- Scissors: 2 (one for each leg pass)\n- Traveling circles: 10\n- Dismount: 1\n\nTotal = 17 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 10 + 1 = 33.\n\nLet me re-verify the count of simple circles vs. those within spindles.\nMy definition: \"A complete 360-degree circle of the legs (e.g., standard circle, flair, or the circular leg motion within a spindle/Magyar).\"\nSo, a spindle *is* a movement, and it *contains* a leg circle. The way I listed it above is counting the spindle as its own element.\n\nLet's list each counted movement:\n1. Circle\n2. Circle\n3. Circle\n4. Flair to handstand\n5. Spindle\n6. Circle\n7. Circle\n8. Circle\n9. Circle\n10. Circle\n11. Circle\n12. Circle\n13. Spindle\n14. Circle\n15. Circle\n16. Circle\n17. Circle\n18. Circle\n19. Circle\n20. Circle\n21. Scissor (R leg)\n22. Scissor (L leg)\n23. Circle\n24. Circle\n25. Circle\n26. Traveling Circle\n27. Traveling Circle\n28. Traveling Circle\n29. Traveling Circle\n30. Traveling Circle\n31. Traveling Circle\n32. Traveling Circle\n33. Traveling Circle\n34. Traveling Circle\n35. Traveling Circle\n36. Dismount\n\nThis list has 36 items, which matches my initial detailed count.\n\nThe reasoning is that each distinct skill or full rotation of the legs is counted.\n- Standard circles are counted individually.\n- Complex skills like spindles (which inherently include a leg circle) are counted as one skill.\n- Transitional skills like scissors are counted per leg action.\n- The handstand entry and the dismount are counted as single, distinct elements.\n\nFinal count is 36.\n\n\\boxed{36}", "predicted_count": 36, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}

The weights are then lowered back to the starting position.\n\n**Analyzing the Video Frame by Frame:**\n\n*   **0:00 - 0:01:** The blogger is in a bent-over position, holding dumbbells with his arms hanging down. This is a common starting position for exercises like bent-over rows or bent-over lateral raises.\n*   **0:01 - 0:02:** The blogger raises the dumbbells out to his sides, keeping his arms relatively straight. His arms move laterally, away from his torso, in the frontal plane (relative to his bent-over torso).\n*   **0:02 - 0:03:** The blogger lowers the dumbbells back to the starting position.\n\nThis movement, where the arms are raised laterally while bent over, is characteristic of a **bent-over lateral raise** (also known as a reverse fly or rear delt raise), which targets the posterior deltoids (rear shoulder muscles) and upper back muscles.\n\nA **front raise**, by contrast, involves lifting the arms *forward* in front of the body, primarily targeting the anterior deltoids (front shoulder muscles).\n\nThroughout the entire video, the blogger consistently performs this bent-over lateral raise movement from various camera angles:\n*   **Rep 1:** Upward movement from ~0:01 to ~0:02.\n*   **Rep 2:** Upward movement from ~0:04 to ~0:05.\n*   **Rep 3:** Upward movement from ~0:07 to ~0:08.\n*   **Rep 4 (new angle):** Upward movement from ~0:10 to ~0:11.\n*   **Rep 5:** Upward movement from ~0:13 to ~0:14.\n*   **Rep 6 (new angle):** Upward movement from ~0:16 to ~0:17.\n*   **Rep 7:** Upward movement from ~0:19 to ~0:20.\n*   **Rep 8 (new angle):** Upward movement from ~0:24 to ~0:25.\n*   **Rep 9 (new angle):** Upward movement from ~0:29 to ~0:30.\n\nAt no point in the video does the blogger perform a movement where he raises the dumbbells forward in front of his body, which would constitute a front raise.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n1.  A front raise involves lifting weights directly in front of the body, with arms moving in the sagittal plane.\n2.  The video shows the blogger bent over at the waist.\n3.  From this bent-over position, the blogger lifts the dumbbells out to his sides, with his arms moving laterally, away from his body. This movement is perpendicular to the direction required for a front raise.\n4.  The exercise being performed is a bent-over lateral raise (or reverse fly), not a front raise.\n\nTherefore, the number of front raise movements completed by the blogger is zero.\n\n\\boxed{0}", "predicted_count": 0, "error": null, "model_name": "gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06"}
